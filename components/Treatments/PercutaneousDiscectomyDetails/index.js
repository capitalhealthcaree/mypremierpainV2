            <h4>Percutaneous Discectomy</h4>
            <p>
              Approximately two percent of the U.S. population suffers from back
              pain (or millions of adults). Herniated discs that press on nerve
              fibers or the spinal cord may be treated with a lumbar
              percutaneous discectomy.By removing deviated disc material and
              disc fragments, lumbar percutaneous discectomy is intended to
              relieve nerve compression.This minimally invasive procedure
              involves making an incision between the vertebrae and inserting a
              tiny surgical needle into the disc middle.

            <h2>What Is A Discectomy?</h2>
            <p>
              Discectomy involves surgically removing parts of a herniated or
              slipped disc in order to relieve pressure on nerve roots or the
              spinal cord. Decompressing the spine is necessary to increase
              flexibility and mobility. There may be some pain associated with a
              herniated disc, but this usually subsides once the disc is removed
              from the spinal cord. Those suffering from chronic pain in their
              lower backs and legs may benefit from discectomy treatment.

              (heat)
            </li>
            <li>Aspirate material in a controlled manner</li>

            <h2>How Is A Percutaneous Discectomy (Pd) Performed?</h2>
            <li>
              To minimize pain and stress on the body, patients are administered
              sedatives and local anesthetics before the procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
              After positioning the patient face down, the surgeon ensures that
              the affected area is easily accessible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The goal is to insert a large needle into the surgical site after
              numbing it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most herniated discs can be relieved by removing disc material,
              which also reduces the pressure within the spinal column. The
              patient will be moved to the recovery area for observation as soon
              as the needle insertion site has been closed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat waves are used to reduce the disc size once the needle is
              inserted, as well as to remove disruptive material from the disc.
            </li>
            <li>
              PDs are usually performed as outpatient procedures and take about
              30 minutes to complete. It is generally possible for patients to
              return home the same day that they have undergone surgery, within
              one to three hours of their surgery. In the first 24 to 48 hours
              following an injection, there may be some discomfort at the
              injection site.
            </li>
            <li>
              It may be necessary to apply heat packs or cold packs to the
              patient's body in order to relieve this discomfort, as needed and
              as recommended. Your physician may prescribe pain medication
              post-PD if it is necessary for you to take it as directed. A
              patient should also rest for at least 24 hours following surgery
              in order to ensure that their recovery will be as smooth as
              possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite the fact that recovery time varies from case to case, most
              patients find that after a week or so, they are able to return to
              their normal daily routines.
            </li>

              Lancaster.

            <li>

              anesthesia; the patient will receive a local anesthetic and may
              also be under mild sedation. The insertion of the needle is
              painless.
            </li>
            <li>

              decompression takes place quite quickly. In about 30 minutes, the
