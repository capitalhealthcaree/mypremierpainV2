              (TPIs). When muscles are not relaxed, trigger points can cause
              pain, as can knots in the muscles. Under the skin, one can often
              feel these knots. Referred pain may result from trigger points. An
              instance of this type of pain occurs in a different part of the
              body. Musculoskeletal conditions, such as chronic muscle pain, are

              by physicians. In addition to sleeping in the wrong position or
              lifting heavy weights vigorously, a variety of factors can
              contribute to muscle pain. Although many types of muscle pain
              resolve after a few days of rest, people with persistent or
              chronic muscle pain may need medical treatment.

              Chronic muscle pain can negatively impact a person's quality of
              life as well as their ability to function. An injection of trigger
              points may provide immediate relief for those suffering from
              chronic muscular pain.

            <h2>What Are Trigger Points?</h2>
            <p>
              Trigger points occur as a result of a knot or band of muscle or
              connective tissue with a high degree of sensitivity, causing
              discomfort or pain. Most commonly, they are found in the back,
              neck, and buttocks, although they can affect nearly any part of
              the body. Trigger point pain can also cause{" "}

              migraines in addition to muscle spasms and weakness. There are a
              number of other factors that can result in trigger points, in

                As well as latent trigger points, active trigger points are also
                considered trigger points. The presence of a trigger point may
                result in pain, even if the user is at rest. A latent trigger
                point is irritated by pressure.

              If other <Link href="/treatments">treatments</Link> have failed to
              alleviate your trigger point pain, it may be appropriate to
              undergo a trigger point injection. Treatment options include
              physical therapy, heat therapy, massage therapy, and myofascial
              release. Physical therapy and stretching exercises are typically
              combined with trigger point injections North Richland Hills to
              alleviate pain. Trigger point injections can be particularly
              useful if used as an initial treatment for patients who cannot
              tolerate physical therapy or stretching. Due to intense pain, this
              is the case. Trigger point injections Hilsboro can improve
              physical therapy effectiveness.

            <p>
              Prior to recommending a trigger point injection, your healthcare
              provider will need to perform a thorough physical examination.
              This will eliminate any potential causes of your pain.

            <h2>What Happens During a Trigger Point Injection?</h2>
            <p>
              Trigger point injections are performed with a small needle
              inserted into the patient's trigger point. Injections usually
              contain local anesthetics and saline, as well as corticosteroids,
              if necessary. By injecting into the trigger point, the pain is
              relieved and the trigger point becomes inactive. A brief treatment
              course usually provides sustained relief. Most injections are
              administered in the doctor's office and take only a few minutes to
              administer. Several locations may be used to administer a single
              injection. Patients allergic to a particular drug may benefit from
              the dry-needle technique.
            </p>
            <h2>What Should You Expect From A Trigger Point Injection?</h2>
            <p>
              The area may feel numb for the first few hours following the
              procedure. Additionally, it may be painful and sore. Trigger Point
              injections are not associated with other health problems. Skin
              infections may occur at the injection site. Injections
              administered in the chest area are associated with pneumothorax
              risk.

              to a large or small degree, depending on the severity of the
              condition. Pain may return after the medication wears off. If your
              symptoms recur, your physician may recommend additional injections
              or other treatment. Your physician's instructions should be
              followed carefully. Please contact your physician if you
