              Electric shock, numbness, or weakness may result from spinal
              problems in the neck or back. A spinal nerve is inflamed,
              resulting in these symptoms. Throughout the body, the spinal
              nerves control movement and pain perception. A cervical
              radiculopathy occurs when a spinal nerve is irritated. An{" "}

            <h2>What is Injected?</h2>
            <p>
              An injection of local anaesthesia is administered to the affected
              area. The treatment may include steroids. During injection,
              steroids serve only as anti-inflammatory agents. Steroids may
              prolong local anesthesia. Injections of steroids do not have the
              same side effects as prolonged oral administration. Diabetics may
              experience an adverse effect on their blood sugar levels if they
              suffer from this condition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Steroid injections into the epidural space are prohibited.
              Generally, this is a common practice, and there is a lot of
              research that supports their safe use in this manner. X-rays will
              help the doctor determine the appropriate position for the
              injection. Additionally, a contrast agent (DYE) will be used to
              confirm that the medicine has been delivered to the appropriate
              location. As a result, the procedure risk is also reduced.
            </p>

              anesthesia injection involves injecting an anesthetic into the
              epidural space surrounding your spine. In order to prevent pain
              signals from traveling from the spine to the brain, we accomplish
              this by blocking them from traveling. An epidural space is a space
              around the spinal cord that is filled with a fluid that surrounds
              it. A liquid sleeve surrounds your{" "}
              <Link href="/treatments/spinal-cord-stimulation">

              and protects it from external harm.
            </p>
            <p>
              In all parts of your body, the spinal cord is used as a highway
              that connects nerves to the brain so that you can communicate with
              each other. Through your spinal cord, for example, you receive a
              pain signal if you have suffered an injury that impacts your body
              in some way. An{" "}

              anesthetic prevents pain signals from reaching a specific part of
              the body by temporarily numbing the spine nerves. You may
              experience this phenomenon depending on where your provider
              injected the epidural along your spine when you received the
              injection. As a temporary measure to relieve pain as well as to
              completely eliminate sensations, epidural anesthesia can be used.
              In the case of an epidural, you may lose feeling for a short
              period of time as a result of the following factors:
            </p>
            <li>
              It is your provider's responsibility to administer anesthesia
              drugs.

              Conversely, spinal epidural nerve block treat chronic pain.
              Instead of anesthetic medication, epidural steroid or
              corticosteroid injections are administered. Steroids reduce pain
              in a particular part of the body by coating irritated nerves and
              reducing swelling. Steroids are used to heal nerves. A spinal{" "}

              staff as soon as you are admitted. A gown will be provided to you
              by the doctor to wear during the examination of your blood
              pressure. A consent form will be provided by the doctor and must
              be signed by you. If you have any questions or you are unsure if
              you understand what has been said, please let me know.

              The nurse will check your blood pressure and pulse in the recovery
              area. As soon as you're ready to get up, your nurse will tell you.
              Rest for approximately an hour. Getting home with a friend or
