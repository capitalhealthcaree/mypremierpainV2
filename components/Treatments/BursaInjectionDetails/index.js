            <li>

              pain returns, additional injections will increase your relief.
            </li>
            <li>
              You should inform your physician of the duration of your relief.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the event that the pain does not subside, you may need to
              consider other possible causes.

            <h2>What Are The Benefits Of A Bursal Injection?</h2>
            <li>
              This procedure involves injecting a small dose of corticosteroid
              and local anesthetic into the bursa in an effort to reduce any
              inflammation that may be present in the area.
            </li>
            <li>This procedure should reduce pain and swelling.</li>
            <li>
              It is sometimes necessary to inject the bursa in order to
              determine whether it is the cause of the pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              Injections that significantly reduce pain suggest that it is a
              bursa that caused the pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is unlikely that your pain is arising from the bursa or
              adjacent structures if there has been no improvement in your
              condition. Moreover, if this is the case, the doctor you see will
              need to investigate other causes of your symptoms.
            </li>
            <h2>How Does A Bursa Injection Affect The Body?</h2>
            <li>
              There may be different side effects and complications associated
              with bursa injections depending on where they are administered.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is no doubt that the injection of a bursa as a means of
              treating bursitis is a safe procedure.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the days following the injection, you may experience
              discomfort, swelling, and bruising in the joint. Infection is also
              possible.
