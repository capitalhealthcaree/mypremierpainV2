              It is the sacroiliac joints (SI) that connect the spine to the
              pelvis at its base. Inflammation of the SI joint is frequently
              responsible for lower back pain. As well as groins, buttocks, and
              legs being affected, it may also result in back pain. These
              symptoms can occur for a number of reasons, but they are very
              common. In order to begin an appropriate treatment plan for SI
              joint dysfunction, it is vital that your doctor confirms that this
              is the cause of your pain. Generalized pain treatments do not work

            <h2>Are Sacroiliac Joint Injections Beneficial To Me?</h2>
            <p>
              Depending on the cause of your pain, your healthcare provider may
              perform a Si Joint injection Richardson . The large pelvis bones
              (ilium) are connected by this joint to the bones in the spine
              (sacrum). The sacroiliac joints are located on both sides of the
              body, one on each side.
            </p>
            <p>
              These bones connect each side of the pelvis to the sacrum. As
              shock absorbers, these joints perform this function. During the
              movement of the legs and the upper body, they transmit weight and
              forces. A sacroiliac joint disorder may result in pain in the
              lower back, the buttocks or the hips. If you undergo a sacroiliac
              joint injection, you may experience pain related to the sacroiliac
              joint. This procedure can also relieve pain in that area.
