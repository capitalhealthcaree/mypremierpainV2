            <h4>Peripheral Nerve Stimulation</h4>
            <p>
              Peripheral nerve stimulation Fort Worth involves implanting
              electrodes in the body to alter how the nervous system functions.
              In order to stimulate peripheral nerves and fields in the area of
              pain, electrodes are put directly on the nerves or under the skin.
              A small incision is all it takes for this minimally invasive
              procedure. As opposed to spinal cord stimulation, which is where
              the nerve originates, peripheral nerve stimulation North Richland
              Hills stimulates the nerve directly. It is pertinent to note that
              this difference is significant.

            <h2>How Does Peripheral Nerve Stimulation Work?</h2>
            <p>
              Normally, the peripheral nerve stimulation Hillsboro process
              consists of two stages, separated by several days.
            </p>
            <h3>STAGE 1 (ELECTRODE IMPLANTATION)</h3>
            <p>
              Your skin will be cleaned with an antiseptic in the operating
              room. If you require light general anesthesia, you will receive a
              local anesthetic and be lightly sedated. It will be necessary to
              make an incision in order to identify the nerve and prepare it for
              surgery. The nerve will be surrounded by one or more electrodes
              (wires) depending on its location. It will be necessary to insert
              and secure these devices through the skin. In the recovery room,
              the patient will spend some time after receiving treatment before
              returning to his or her bedside. A pain monitor attached to an
              external stimulator will monitor your pain for several days.
              Throughout the admissions process, you'll describe and score your
              pain. It will be possible to determine the effectiveness of the
              treatment through the use of this procedure. In this manner, you
              will be able to determine if the level of pain relief you have
              received is satisfactory.
            </p>
            <h3>STAGE 2 (BATTERY INSERTION)</h3>
            <p>
              You will be able to undergo the full implantation several days or
              a week later if you are satisfied with the amount of pain relief
              you obtained from the trial. The procedure requires a general
              anesthetic (you will be asleep during the procedure). Extending
              the temporary wire extensions removes the temporary electrodes and
              connects them to extension wires connected to battery packs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Implanting this battery usually involves placing it in your chest,
              back, or abdomen Moreover, over the next few days and weeks, your
              battery will be programmed so you get the best stimulation
              possible.

            <h2>After Implanting The Pns Device, How Does It Work?</h2>
            <p>
              You will receive detailed instructions from your doctor regarding
              the use of the device. If you are having an MRI or going through
              airport security, you may receive additional instructions. It is
              patient-friendly, according to Dr. Deer. "Patients do not need to
              wear the external part of the PNS device all the time; they only
              need to wear it when they are experiencing pain," he states.
              Patients are able to remove their external parts to bathe, shower,
              and swim. Most complications associated with PNS are superficial
              skin infections, although bleeds and nerve damage are possible
              occasionally. With new devices, the implants remain in place and
              there is no movement of the lead wires, which is known as "lead
              migration." It may be necessary to reprogramme the computer on an
              annual basis. Moreover, if the device does not relieve your pain,
              it may be removed. Dr. ali pain management, has done extensive
              research on peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) as a method of
              relieving chronic pain.
