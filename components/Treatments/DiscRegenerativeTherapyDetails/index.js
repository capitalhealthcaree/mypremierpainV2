            <p>
              Regenerative medicine has made significant advances in modern
              medicine. The therapies developed in this field will revolutionize
              musculoskeletal treatments. Over the past few decades, most
              musculoskeletal{" "}

              have not effectively treated the underlying causes of
              musculoskeletal disorders, but only addressed their symptoms.
              Using advancements in regenerative medicine, trained physicians
              can modify and treat a patient's underlying problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              As opposed to simply treating the symptoms of the problem, this is
              a more comprehensive approach. In some instances, regenerative
              medicine is superior to conventional medicine. These revolutionary
              therapies have evolved over many years from novel ideas to proven
              and effective evidence-based treatments for previously unsolvable
              problems.

            <h2>How does Disc Regenerative Therapy Help?</h2>
            <p>
              In addition to relieving pain, DRT often removes the cause of
              pain, triggering the body's natural healing mechanisms. A
              degenerative disc disease occurs when the discs between the
              vertebrae in the spine become less supple and more vulnerable to
              damage and inflammation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The DRT procedure involves injecting a solution of glucosamine and
              dextrose into the disc center in order to facilitate the healing
              of the disc. These natural substances increase the strength of the
              painful disc by stimulating collagen fibers in the cartilage. By
              taking glucosamine by mouth, osteoarthritis pain is reduced and
              the rate of degeneration is slowed. DRT involves the application
              of the solution directly to the damaged disc, ensuring that it
              reaches the damage area as soon as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disc treatment may result in permanent improvement by working with
              the body's ability to heal itself.
            </p>
            <h2>Expected Results</h2>
            <p>
              DRT has been demonstrated to reduce pain and increase activity
              levels in clinical trials. If the intervertebral disc is altered
              in a favorable manner, then pain and disability may be reduced.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, pain management specialists are incorporating disc
              regenerative therapy into their treatment plans for chronic
              discogenic pain patients despite further research being conducted.
              This technique is becoming more popular due to positive results.
              Additionally, it reduces surgical interventions.
