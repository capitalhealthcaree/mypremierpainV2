            <h2>Procedure For Blocking Sympathetic Nerves</h2>
            <li>
              Nerve blocks are usually administered according to your pain
              location. A thick network of nerves called ganglia connects your
              sympathetic nerves outside your spinal column.
            </li>
            <li>
              A blockage of the Stellate ganglion in the neck area may provide
              pain relief for people experiencing pain in the upper part of
              their body.
            </li>
            <li>
              A lumbar sympathetic block may target a ganglion near the lower
              spine to relieve pain in the lower body. You will lie face down on
              the table during the X-ray procedure. Low-dose sedatives like
              diazepam or midazolam are good to use.{" "}
              <Link href="/conditions-we-treat/back-pain">Lower back</Link> skin
              is numb with a local anesthetic injection. As long as you are
              awake, you can provide feedback to your physician.
            </li>
            <li>
              Under fluoroscopic guidance (x-ray), the doctor will insert a
              hollow needle through the skin and direct it towards the lumbar
              sympathetic ganglia. In real time, the fluoroscope allows the
              physician to observe needle movement. An injection of contrast dye
              ensures proper placement. In most cases, patients feel pressure
              more than pain when uncomfortable.
            </li>
            <li>
              The medication will be injected into the body once the needle has
              been properly placed. It is now time to remove the needle.
