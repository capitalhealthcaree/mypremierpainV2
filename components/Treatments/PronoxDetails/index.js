            <h2>PronoX Pain Relief System in Dallas, TX</h2>
            <p>
              Many patients are reluctant or even fearful of undergoing
              minimally invasive procedures involving needles in order to manage
              their pain. Patients may be interested in maximizing their level
              of comfort during treatment in some cases. Having a convenient and
              comfortable way to alleviate anxiety while undergoing treatment is
              now available at the Dallas Premier Pain Centers. In this way,
              they will be able to gain a deeper understanding of interventional
              pain medicine's impressive potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of nitrous oxide in Pronox is intended to provide a
              fast-acting analgesic (pain relief). Numerous studies have
              demonstrated that this method is an effective and low-cost way to
              reduce anxiety and pain during non-surgical procedures. A local
              anesthetic, such as lidocaine, is enhanced by ProNox, particularly
              in anxious patients. As Vicodin (a pain reliever) and Valium (a
              muscle relaxant) take time to take effect, patients require a
              driver to drive them home. In contrast, Pro-Nox provides immediate
              pain relief and wears off rapidly, allowing patients to drive
              safely home.

            <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
            <li>
              When a patient uses the Pronox system, he or she receives a
              single-use tube which is connected to the device.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to breathe deeply, the patient must hold his or her
              breath for approximately 30 seconds while breathing through the
              tubing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Following the establishment of the effects of the nitrous oxide,
              the procedure may be carried out.
            </li>
            <li>
              A patient may continue breathing according to his or her
              preferences for approximately three to five minutes after the
              effects of nitrous oxide have worn off.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, the patient has the ability to determine the amount
              of nitrous oxide that will be breathed during the procedure as
              well as the level of effect they wish to experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Within five minutes of completing the procedure, the gas is
              emitted from the patient's system.
            </li>
            <h4>1. Self-administered By the Patient</h4>
            <p>
              ProNox Richardson has the greatest advantage in that it puts you,
              the patient, in control. Only you are aware of what your body is
              capable of and what your pain threshold is. The range of relief
              offered by ProNox depends on your individual needs. Analgesia
              dosage can be controlled using the ProNox system. Depending on how
              much relief you need, you may be able to move the disposable
              hand-held breathing tube.
            </p>
            <h4>2. Nitrous Oxide and Oxygen Mixture</h4>
            <p>
              Using a hand-held breathing tube, patients inhale oxygen/nitrous
              oxide mixture. Patients are able to manage their pain with the
              help of a 50/50 mixture. As a matter of fact, it has been shown
              that the use of this drug is non-addictive and that it can delay
              the need for other pain medications. ProNox Hilsboro is remarkable
              for its ability to remove the chemical from the body after 5 to 10
              minutes. Consequently, you are able to return to your daily
              activities and drive yourself home in safety.
