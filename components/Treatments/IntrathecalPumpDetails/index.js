            <h3>Intrathecal Pump</h3>
            <p>
              An intrathecal pump may be helpful if you are experiencing chronic
              pain due to cancer or another illness. An Intrathecal pump North
              Richland Hills is an implanted device for treating pain. In this
              method, pain medication is delivered directly to the spinal cord.
              As compared to taking the same medication by mouth, you will
              require considerably less medication to control pain. This
              enhances the effectiveness of the medication. In addition, fewer
              side effects are likely to occur.
            </p>
            <h2>Intrathecal Drug Pumps: What Are They?</h2>
            <p>
              A fluid-filled space surrounds your spinal cord, known as the
              subarachnoid or intrathecal space. CSF, which bathes and protects
              the brain and spinal cord, flows through this area. By delivering
              medicine directly into the CSF, intrathecal drug pumps are more
              efficient than oral medication since they bypass the path taken by
              oral medications through the body. The amount of medication needed
              with a pump is generally 1/300 that required when taken orally
              (morphine or baclofen).

            <p>
              The following criteria may determine whether you are suitable for
              intrathecal drug delivery:
              <li>The conservative approach has failed</li>
              <li>Additional surgery would not be beneficial to you</li>
              <li>Pain medication is a necessity for you</li>
              <li>Psychological problems do not exist in you</li>
              <li>Medical conditions do not preclude the use of implants</li>
              <li>
                The drugs used in the pump do not cause an allergic reaction in
                you
              </li>
              <li>
                A trial dose of medication has shown positive results for you
              </li>

            <h2>Intrathecal Pain Pump Implant: Why Do We Need It?</h2>
            <p>
              An Intrathecal Pump Richardson may be considered in the case of
              chronic pain induced by an injury or cancer pain caused by a
              disease or injury. Pain management with this method may be
              beneficial when other types of pain management have failed to
              provide relief or have caused severe side effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is necessary to test Intrathecal pump Fort Worth before they
              are implanted to ensure they will work in your case. This is known
              as a trial. It is possible that you will receive an injection of
              pain medication. Alternatively, an intrathecal pain pump may be
              tested for a short period of time (temporary). In the course of
              this procedure:
            </p>
            <li>
              It is necessary for you to lie face down on a medical table. Over
              your spine, there is a numbed area in your back.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, the doctor may administer medications in order to help you
              relax or fall asleep.
            </li>
            <li>
              A portion of the spine is incised by the healthcare provider. In
              order to perform this procedure, a stiff tube is inserted through
              the skin. There is an intrathecal space surrounding the spinal
              cord.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is necessary for the provider to insert a thin, flexible tube
              (catheter) into the intrathecal space. In order to determine
              whether the pain medication is effective, the tube delivers it for
              a few days.
            </li>
            <p>
              The pain relief trial will result in a pump implant. This
              procedure results in:
            </p>
            <li>A new catheter is inserted under the skin by the physician.</li>
            <li>
              One inch of your lower abdomen (abdomen) is then placed with the
              pump. An inch-thick, three-inch-wide disk is the pump. A five- to
              seven-year battery powers it. Pump connects to the catheter.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then, the provider connects the pumps to small devices outside of
              the body.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to control the pump, the provider uses this device.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additionally, the amount can be set at a certain level. It depends
              on your type of pain and other factors what type of medication
              will be used in the pump.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is necessary to refill the pump with medicine as needed. It is
              possible for this to occur every one to three months.
            </li>
            <h2>How Are The Results Expected To Be Achieved?</h2>
            <p>
              Based on the severity of the disease and the underlying cause,
              treatment outcomes may vary. In addition to reducing pain, chronic
              pain sufferers may also experience improvements in their
              activities of daily living. You might see less rigidity and spasms
              if you suffer from spasticity. Moreover, by directly reaching the
              spinal cord and delivering the medicine in smaller doses, it is
              easier for patients to take less medicine. Let's schedule an
              appointment right away.
