      <p>
        The duration of acute pain ranges from minutes to three months
        (sometimes six months). Soft-tissue injuries and temporary illnesses
        often cause acute pain, which goes away after they heal. Chronic pain
        includes{" "}

          headaches

        that last months or years, even if they're not always present. Chronic
        pain is often caused by arthritis, fibromyalgia, or spine problems.

        Neuropathic pain is caused by nerve or nervous system damage. Pain is
        frequently characterized as shooting, stabbing, burning, or tingling
        sensations. It can also impair touch sensitivity and make hot and cold
        sensations difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compression or inflammation of the spinal nerve causes radicular pain.
        It radiates from the back and hip to the legs via the spine and spinal
        nerve root. Radicular pain may induce paresthesia, anesthesia, and
        muscular debilitation. Radiculopathy is back-to-leg pain. The pain comes
        from the sciatic nerve, hence sciatica.
