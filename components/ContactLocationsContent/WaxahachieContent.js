        Neuropathy, another focus, causes tingling, numbness, and muscle

        autonomic neuropathy using a variety of therapies based on type and
        severity. Treatments may include TENS, spinal cord stimulation,
        medication, physical therapy, or surgery for severe cases. Managing
        symptoms, improving quality of life, and addressing nerve damage causes
        are the goals. Sciatica, caused by sciatic nerve compression, is another
        specialty. Our <b>pain management doctors</b> know that sciatica can
        cause pain, tingling, or numbness along the nerve. Herniated discs, bone
        spurs, and spinal stenosis can cause sciatica. For pain and mobility,
        epidural steroid injections, nerve block injections, and disc
        decompression are available. Our{" "}
