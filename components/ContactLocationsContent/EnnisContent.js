      <h2>Effects of Chronic Pain</h2>
      <p>
        Chronic pain lasts more than 3-6 months. This pain usually persists
        after the illness or injury ends. When nervous system pain signals
        persist for months or years, chronic pain can result. Rarely, people
        without injuries or illnesses may experience chronic pain. More than 1.5
        billion people worldwide have chronic pain, according to the American
        Academy of Pain Medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stressful physical effects of chronic pain can be felt by patients.
        Movement restriction, tense muscles, fatigue, sleep, and appetite loss
        are examples. The patient may experience anger, depression, anxiety,
        irritation, pain, fear, etc. Chronic pain's physical and emotional
        effects can make life miserable and prevent a person from returning to
        work and fun.
      </p>
      <h2>Chronic Pain Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        No single treatment can treat all chronic pain. Specific painful
        conditions can be managed and treated in many ways. Treat the underlying
        causes of pain first. Chronic pain treatments vary by medical condition,
        disease, and type.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pain Center's healthcare professionals collaborate with patients to
        create a comprehensive pain management and elimination plan.
        Self-management skills, lifestyle changes, and genuine efforts to
        improve mental and physical health are emphasized. The treatment plan
        includes behavioral and psychological therapies.
