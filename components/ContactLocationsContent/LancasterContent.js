          best pain management doctors in Dallas
        </Link>{" "}
        and skilled staff provide the latest and most effective pain management
        solutions, including:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Epidural steroid injection—for nerve root irritation or inflammation
            from degenerative or herniated discs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Facet injection—for temporary or permanent spine joint pain from
            degeneration, injury, or arthritis.
          </li>

          <li>
            The greater occipital nerve block is an injection of steroid and
            local anesthetic in the back of the head to relieve headaches caused
            by nerve irritation or pinching.
          </li>
          <li>
            Needle electromyography (EMG) and nerve velocity (NCV) tests detect
            nerve and muscle damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sympathetic block—an injection around the sympathetic nerve that
            causes injury-related pain. CRPS and RSD are treated or diagnosed
            with this option.
          </li>
          <li>
            Radiofrequency ablation deactivates nerves that supply spine facet
            joints, disrupting nerve conduction to reduce back and neck pain.
          </li>
          <li>Cryoanalgesia—freezing nerves to relieve pain</li>
          <li>
            A local anesthetic and steroid injection into the muscle to treat
            muscle pain is called a trigger point injection/myoneural block.
