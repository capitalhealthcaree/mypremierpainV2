            <h2>Integrated Pain Management - What Is It?</h2>
            <p>
              A treatment that actively addresses the causes and symptoms of
              chronic pain is interventional pain management. If conservative
              options such as physical therapy and medication are not working,
              Pain Management of Dallas, can help. Besides restoring function,
              they also repair tissues.
            </p>
            <h2>What Conditions Can Interventional Pain Management Treat?</h2>
            <p>
              These are just some of the chronic pain causes the team can treat:

                Back pain
              </Link>{" "}
              and Neck pain are very common conditions that affect people of all
              ages. These conditions include subluxations (misalignments of the
              spine), herniated discs and , spinal stenosis and degenerative
              disc disease. Often, the worst pain you experience is caused by
              radiculopathy, which is when your spine's nerves are compressed or
              damaged at the time they exit the vertebrae.

              is arthritis, which is the gradual deterioration of your joints.
              In addition to osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis is an
              autoimmune disease that takes many forms.

              <b>Pain Syndromes:</b> Several chronic illnesses, including
              fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, and complex regional pain syndrome
              (CRPS), cause intense and widespread pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Leg Pain:</b> Leg pain can occur due to problems within the
              leg, in the spine, or in the pelvis. A person's leg may be in pain
              due to an injury to the muscles, bones, or nerves. An underlying
              condition or trauma may cause leg pain. Depending on the cause of
              the{" "}

            <li>
              <b>Shoulder Pain:</b> Shoulder pain has a variety of causes, not
              all of which are related to the shoulder joints or associated
              structures. Home treatments are available for the treatment of{" "}

              your condition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Peripheral Neuropathy:</b> An individual suffering from
              neuropathy is experiencing pain or other unpleasant sensations
              outside the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). A
              diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which affects the lower limbs in
              diabetic patients, as well as postherpetic neuralgia, a
              complication of shingles, are examples.

              , uses a variety of interventional pain management techniques,
              including:
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Kyphoplasty:</b> Typically, kyphoplasty is used in the
              treatment of painful compression fractures of the spine. When a
              spinal bone is fractured by a compression fracture, all or part of
              it collapses. Kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive surgical
              procedure that involves a small puncture of the skin as opposed to
              a larger incision (open surgery). According to the following
              description, a typical Kyphoplasty procedure takes between one and
              two hours per vertebral level.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Nerve Blocks:</b> The purpose of nerve blocks is to target
              nerve clusters that are responsible for chronic pain. In the case
              of chronic{" "}
              <Link href="/conditions-we-treat/headaches/" rel="preload">
                headaches
              </Link>{" "}
              and migraines, a nerve block is a procedure in which numbing
              medicine is injected into the sphenopalatine ganglion. Complex
              regional pain syndrome may be relieved by a Stellate Ganglion
              nerve block.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Steroid Injections:</b> The effects of steroids are to reduce
              inflammation and pain. A local anesthetic may also be included in
              the injections in order to numb the pain for a short period of
              time. You may be injected with steroids into the epidural space
              around your spine by your{" "}

              connect your vertebrae, as well as in other joints that are
              damaged.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Radiofrequency Ablation:</b> As a result of radiofrequency
              ablation, heat is created in the nerve tissue that transmits
              chronic pain signals to the brain. Nerves are destroyed by heat,
              so they can no longer transmit pain signals. Occasionally, spinal
              cord stimulation or peripheral nerve stimulation may be necessary
              for patients whose condition does not improve. If you are
              experiencing chronic pain, contact{" "}
