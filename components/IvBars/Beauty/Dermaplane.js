									Dermaplane is a less-invasive cosmetic technique. The process
									removes light wrinkles and deep acne scars and smooths the
									skin. Our specialists utilize specific equipment to shave your
									top skin layers. Dead skin cells and peach fuzz are removed
									with dermaplaning, revealing brighter, more youthful skin.
									Dermaplane is done by our skilled dermatologists or
									cosmetologists at Premier Pain Centers. Our skilled
									aestheticians provide the <b>best dermaplane</b> facials,
									delivering smooth, glowing skin with gentle, precise care.
									Before surgery, they'll:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<i className="icofont-check-circled"></i>
										Discuss your procedure's aims
									</li>
									<li>
										<i className="icofont-check-circled"></i>
										Check your skin for wellness before the procedure
									</li>
									<li>
										<i className="icofont-check-circled"></i>
										Expectations before, during, and after dermaplaning
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									We sometimes take images of the treatment area. Dermaplaning
									photographs show “before” and “after” effects. We'll also tell
									you if you need to stop smoking for a few weeks before the
									treatment. No smoking may speed recovery after treatment.

					<h3 className="pt-3">How to Do Dermaplane Procedure?</h3>
					<p>
						Advanced skincare treatments to attain a beautiful complexion are
						our specialty. Non-invasive <b>dermaplane facial</b> exfoliates skin
						to leave it smooth, vibrant, and invigorated. Dermaplaning doesn't
						require general anesthesia, although our dermatologist may apply a
						numbing cream or spray 30 minutes prior. Dermaplaning may scrape or
						sting, but it's usually painless.
						<p>
							{" "}
							Hair and skin cells are removed with a dermatome. The instrument
							resembles an electric razor. A tiny blade slides across your skin
							in the dermatome. It softly removes the top layers of skin without
							cutting. We then apply a calming gel or ointment to minimize
							redness, swelling, and irritation. The treatment takes a few
							minutes to an hour and a half. The size of the treatment area
							determines the length of the process.
