            <h2>TREATING SHOULDER PAIN IN FORT WORTH</h2>
            <h4>Possible Causes Behind Shoulder Pain</h4>
            <p>
              The shoulder is actually a collection of joints, tendons, and
              muscles that allow your arm to move in a variety of ways - from
              scratching your back to throwing the perfect pitch. The cost of
              mobility, however, is high. Consequently, you may experience pain
              or instability in your shoulder due to impingement or instability
              of soft tissues or bony structures. Your shoulder may be painful
              only when you move it, or it may be painful all the time. Symptoms
              of pain can range from temporary to persistent, and may require
              medical treatment and diagnosis.

              <b>The most common causes for knee pain include:</b>
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Dislocation</b>: When you pull back your shoulder too hard or
              rotate too far, your arm may pop out. Your shoulder will be
              painful and weak. Bruising, swelling, and numbness are also common
              symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Separation</b>: A shoulder blade injury occurs when the
              collarbone meets the shoulder blade. Acromioclavicular (AC) is the
              name of this joint.
            </li>
            <li>
              A fall or hard blow may cause the ligaments holding the joint
              together to tear. A bump will appear on the top of your shoulder
              if your collarbone is out of place.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fracture. Falling or taking a hard blow can cause a bone to break
              or crack. Broken clavicles and humeruses (bones closest to the
              shoulder) are most often the result of an accident. Bruises and
              pain will be experienced as a result. It may be impossible for you
              to lift your arm.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cartilage Tear</b>: A shoulder injury can result from an injury
              to the cartilage (the rubbery padding that surrounds the joint
              rim). Performing the same motion repeatedly may result in this
              condition. If you fall or your shoulder absorbs a significant
              amount of force, you may also damage it. Symptoms of this type of
              injury may include pain when reaching over your head and a weak
              shoulder. Furthermore, it may feel as if it is locking, catching,
              or grinding.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Rotator Cuff Tear</b>: Consequently, your joint has a limited
              range of motion due to this condition. An abnormal tissue growth
              (adhesions) within the shoulder joint prevents your shoulder from
              moving freely. As a result of pain or surgery, you may not use
              your shoulder as much, allowing adhesions to form.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Frozen Shoulder</b>: This is a muscle tear or muscle tension in
              the back thigh. Symptoms may include biceps femoris,
              semimembranosus, or semitendinosus.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Impingement</b>: As a result of pinched rotator cuff tendons in
              the shoulder bones, this condition develops. Swelling and pain may
              result from this condition. Lifting your arms over your head
              frequently may cause this problem.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bursitis</b>: Repeatedly repeating the same movements can
              result in swollen and inflamed bursae (a fluid-filled sac that
              cushions your joints). A fall or another injury may also result in
              this condition. Your shoulder may be most painful when you move it
              if you have bursitis.
            </li>

            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Osteoarthritis</b>: Degenerative joint disease is the most
              common form of arthritis. In addition to your shoulders, other
              joints may also be affected. A breakdown of cartilage causes the
              bones to rub against one another. As a result, pain and stiffness
              may occur.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Rheumatoid Arthritis</b>: As a result of this condition, your

              should seek immediate medical assistance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Tendinitis</b>: Inflammation of the rotator cuff occurs when
              the tendons making up the rotator cuff become inflamed.The
              condition may develop slowly over time or after a fall or a direct
              blow to the shoulder.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bone Spurs</b>: These small, smooth bone fragments, also called
              osteophytes, rub against the rotator cuff and cause it to wear.
              This prevents your shoulder from moving as it should. As a result,
              tendinitis or tears of the rotator cuff may occur.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Deep vein thrombosis</b>: This is a type of knee blood clot
              that causes soreness, swelling, and exhaustion. If you are at a
              mature age, obese, a smoker, or have a sedentary lifestyle you may
              be vulnerable to DVT.

              <b>Physiotherapy</b>: Physical therapy and modification of

              options.Physical therapy is intended to address problems such as
              stiffness and weakness. The treatment will also involve retraining
              actions or movements that were aggravating your shoulder in your
              sport, at work, or on a daily basis. By doing so, you will be able
              to resume your previous activities whenever necessary.

              <b>Medication:</b> Hillsboro such as paracetamol,
              anti-inflammatories, and low dose paracetamol can help control
              pain while maintaining and regaining movement and function. Please
              consult your physician if you have high blood pressure, kidney
              disease or heart disease, before taking these medications.Shoulder
              Pain Hillsboro should not be treated with medication on a
              long-term basis. Your physician should be consulted if you
              experience persistent pain. The doctor may recommend a
              corticosteroid injection if the pain persists.
            </li>
            <p>
              Although all medications have side effects, most people are able
              to tolerate an injection to reduce their pain while they recover.
              A repeat injection may be necessary depending on your
              circumstances. Keep a pain diary to monitor the effectiveness of
              your treatment. Depending on the results, you can determine if
              other treatments are necessary. Frozen shoulders may benefit from
              hydrodilation. This procedure involves injecting fluid (saline and
              steroids) into the joint.There is evidence from a number of
              studies that this treatment reduces symptoms and improves range of
              motion. As a follow-up to treatment, physiotherapy can provide
              further improvements.

              is common, it is imperative that they are treated as quickly as
              possible. Your nerves will usually heal and all symptoms will be
              relieved in most cases. Do not stop physical therapy or other
              treatments if you no longer experience symptoms. A numb shoulder
              will not occur again as a result of this procedure. Be aware of
              your symptoms and do not ignore them. You should see a doctor if
              you experience numbness in your shoulder, arm, hand, neck, upper
              back, or shoulder blade.
