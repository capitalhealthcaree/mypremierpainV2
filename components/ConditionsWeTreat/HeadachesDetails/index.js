            <h4>Helping You Find Relief for Migraines</h4>
            <p>
              Headaches are a common ailment that many people experience on a
              semi-frequent basis. While normal headaches may subside with
              lifestyle changes and can often be treated with over-the-counter
              medications, you may need professional assistance if you
              experience chronic headaches or migraines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyone who lives with migraines knows how painful this issue can
              be. A migraine is more than just an inconvenience or annoyance â€”
              people who get migraines are often debilitated by their condition,
              and it can be difficult to find a symptom management plan that is
              right for you.
            </p>

            <h2>What Are the Different Types of Headaches?</h2>
            <p>
              Although many headaches feel the same, there are actually
              different types of headaches that are caused by different
              conditions and sensations within the body. The first step to
              headache treatment is to determine the type of headaches a person
              is experiencing, as each type of headache requires unique care.
            </p>
            <b>Some of the most common types of headaches are:</b>
            <li>
              <b>Migraines</b>: Migraines are characterized by symptoms such as
              extreme pain, light and sound sensitivity, and nausea. They often
              last longer than typical headaches, and migraines are generally a
              chronic condition. Treatment usually involves symptom management;
              however, there is no known cure for migraines.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cluster headaches</b>: Cluster headaches often cause severe
              pain in a localized area of the head, such as around one eye. They
              can also be a chronic issue for sufferers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Occipital neuralgia</b>: While occipital neuralgia causes
              headaches, the pain is actually due to irritation in the nerves of
              the spinal cord. Pain associated with this condition is generally
              felt in the back of the head and the neck.
            </li>
            <h2>Causes of Headaches & Migraines</h2>
            <p>
              Headaches can be caused by a number of health conditions, in
              addition to general wellness considerations such as dehydration or
              tiredness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although there is no certain answer for what causes migraines,
              experts have hypothesized that blood flow in the brain plays a
              role. Some people may be predisposed to experiencing migraines due
              to genetics and other factors; for example, women are three times
              more likely to experience migraines than men.
            </p>
