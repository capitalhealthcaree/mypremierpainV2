            <h2>What Are the Different Types of Headaches?</h2>
            <p>
              Although many headaches feel the same, there are actually
              different types of headaches that are caused by different
              conditions and sensations within the body. The first step to
              headache treatment is to determine the type of headaches a person
              is experiencing, as each type of headache requires unique care.

            <p>
              Headaches can be caused by a number of health conditions, in
              addition to general wellness considerations such as dehydration or
              tiredness. Although there is no certain answer for what causes
              migraines, experts have hypothesized that blood flow in the brain
              plays a role. Some people may be predisposed to experiencing
              migraines due to genetics and other factors; for example, women
              are three times more likely to experience migraines than men. A
              migraine can be caused by:

            <h2>What Is Some Common Diagnosis For Headaches?</h2>
            <p>
              A headache specialist (neurologist) will likely identify migraines
              based on your medical history, symptoms, and a physical and
              neurological examination if you have them or a family history of
              them. However, according to our team at{" "}

              discomfort, your doctor may order the following tests if your
              disease is particularly rare, complicated, or suddenly severe:
            </p>
            <li>
              Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); A high-powered magnetic field
              and radio waves are used in an MRI scan to provide high-resolution
              images of the brain and its blood vessels. Brain and nervous
              system (neurological) disorders, such as tumors, strokes, bleeding
              in the brain, infections, and others, are often detected and
              diagnosed with the aid of MRI scans.
            </li>
            <li>
              Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan, or computerized
              tomography. Detailed cross-sectional images of the brain can be
              created with the help of a CT scan, which is accomplished using a
              sequence of X-rays. This aids in the diagnosis of more serious
              conditions that may be causing the patient's headaches, such as
              brain tumors, infections, brain damage, or bleeding in the brain.
