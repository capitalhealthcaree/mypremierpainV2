            <h2>What Are the Causes of Knee Pain?</h2>
            <p>
              If you experience sharp pain in your knee, you should not overlook
              it. Instead, you should seek the best and advanced treatment. It
              is important to get your condition examined by an experienced

            </p>
            <b>The most common causes for knee pain include:</b>
            <li>
              <b>Leg cramps</b>: Cramps occur when muscles become tight. When
              muscles are overworked, you may experience muscle tension.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Baker's Cyst</b>: This is a condition in which a fluid pocket
              grows in the back of the knee, leading to pain and swelling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Osteoarthritis</b>: This damages and causes inflammation in the
              joint cartilage. You may feel pain in the backside of the knee,
              which hinders movement and bending.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Runner's knee</b>: This is a painful condition in which the
              cartilage in the knee joints become exhausted. Without cartilage,
              the knee bones rub together, causing friction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Hamstring injury</b>: This is a muscle tear or muscle tension
              in the back thigh. Symptoms may include biceps femoris,
              semimembranosus, or semitendinosus.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Meniscus tears</b>: When you rotate your legs while bending or
              crouching, this cartilage can be damaged. This may lead to limited
              function in the knees.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>PCL damage</b>: If you undergo a major accident and your
              ligaments are torn, you are likely to develop a PCL injury. The
              injury is most often identified by knee pain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Deep vein thrombosis</b>: This is a type of knee blood clot
              that causes soreness, swelling, and exhaustion. If you are at a
              mature age, obese, a smoker, or have a sedentary lifestyle you may
              be vulnerable to DVT.
            </li>
            <h2>What About The Structure?</h2>
            <p>
              The knee, together with the ankles and the hips, is responsible
              for supporting the body's weight as you bend and straighten it.
              Also, The knee, though, is more than just a hinged joint; it also
              twists and rotates. And the knee uses its bones, ligaments,
              tendons, and cartilage to carry out all of these functions and
              support the whole body.
            </p>
            <h4>Bones</h4>
            <li>Four bones make up the knee joint.</li>
            <li>
              However, our team of{" "}

              also told us that the patella, often known as the kneecap, glides
              forward on the femur.
            </li>
            <h4>Ligaments</h4>
            <li>
              Fibrous bands of tissue called ligaments hold bones together.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are four major ligaments in the knee that hold the tibia to
              the femur.
            </li>
            <li>
              As our team of{" "}

              </Link>{" "}
              told us Stability in the medial and lateral directions of the knee
              is provided by the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and lateral
              collateral ligament (LCL), respectively, which run along the inner
              (medial) and outer (lateral) sides of the knee.
            </li>
            <h4>Tendons</h4>
            <li>
              Tendons link muscles to bones, while ligaments connect bones to
              one other.
            </li>
            <li>
              The patellar tendon connects the kneecap (patella) to the tibia,
              and the quadriceps tendon attaches to the quadriceps muscle.
            </li>
            <li>
              However, we were able to get all this information with the help of
              our team at{" "}

              .
            </li>
            <h4>Cartilage</h4>
            <li>
              Menisci (singular: meniscus) are cartilaginous structures that
              border the top of the tibia.
            </li>
            <li>The menisci serve primarily as shock absorbers in the knee.</li>
            <h4>Bursae</h4>
            <li>
              Knee padding is provided by fluid-filled sacs called bursae
              (plural of bursa).
            </li>
            <h2>When Should I Call The Doctor About Knee Pain?</h2>
            <p>

              agony, or if your knee is sore or unstable so you can't put any
