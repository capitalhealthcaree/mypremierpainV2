              , and general discomfort in those areas has a range of causes,
              from whiplash and stress-related injuries to bad posture,
              segmental dysfunction, and problems with the discs themselves.
              Causes for these issues vary - from acute injuries to problems
              stemming from birth - and diagnosing and treating the symptoms is
              the first step in helping a patient live pain-free.

              Common symptoms associated with neck and upper back problems

              temporomandibular joint disorder (also known as TMJ), shoulder and

              Neck pain is the worst form of an overachiever. It is so common
              that it is the fourth leading cause of disability worldwide,
              following ischemic heart disease, and low respiratory disease.
              About 30 percent get it each year. And it does not stay in the
              middle of the neck. It can spread in your entire upper body,
              affect your shoulders, arms, and chest, and can even cause{" "}

            <h2>What Are Some Different Types of Neck Pain?</h2>
            <p>
              We got to know from our team which is Treating neck pain in fort
              worth. There are different profiles of neck pain. Some people get
              only one type, while others get a combination.
            </p>
            <li>
              Neuropathic neck pain: From the arteries or nerves to the cervical
              spine, neuropathic pain can cause conditions such as a herniated
              disc pressing against the adjacent nerve, or other causes of nerve
              compression.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mechanical Neck pain: This pain arises from the spine and its
              supporting structures (e.g., muscles, ligaments, bones, or
              cartilage).
            </li>
            <li>
              Neuropathic pain: Usually the result of a stroke, spinal cord
              injury, or multiple sclerosis. It can also be the result of damage
              to the central nervous system, caused by a traumatic brain /
              spinal cord injury or infection (e.g., abscess, encephalitis,
              myelitis)
            </li>
            <h2>What are the basic Causes of Neck pain?</h2>
            <p>
              To our information from Treating{" "}
              <a href="/contact-locations/lancaster/">neck pain in lancaster</a>
              . Because of its role in bearing the body's weight, the neck is
              susceptible to a variety of painful and motion-limiting injuries
              and disorders. Some of the most common reasons for neck pain are:
            </p>
            <li>
              Muscle strains. Muscle strains are frequently brought on by
              overuse, such as when a person spends too much time slumped over a
              computer or a smartphone. Minor activities, such as reading in
              bed, can cause neck muscular discomfort.
            </li>
            <li>
              Worn joints. Age causes wear and tear on the neck's joints just
              like it does on the rest of the body. Bone spurs, a common
              response of the body to this kind of wear and tear, can restrict
              movement and even cause discomfort.
            </li>
            <li>
              Nerve compression. A pinched nerve in the cervical spine may be
              the result of a herniated disc or a bone spur in the cervical
              spine. Our team which is treating neck pain in Hillsboro confirmed
              this.
            </li>
            <li>
              Injuries. Injuries to the neck and shoulders, known as whiplash,
              are common in rear-end car accidents. This happens when the head
              is suddenly jerked backward and then forwards, placing stress on
              the muscles and ligaments of the neck.
            </li>
            <li>
              Diseases. Certain diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis,
              meningitis, or cancer, can cause neck pain.
            </li>
            <h2>Common Neck Pain Conditions</h2>
            <p>
              Constant pain, discomfort, and inhibited movement can drastically
              affect your quality of life. It is important that you seek
              treatment if you suffer from this condition. A few neck pain
