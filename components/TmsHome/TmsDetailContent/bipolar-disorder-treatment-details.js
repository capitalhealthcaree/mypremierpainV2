              Bipolar disorder involves a chronic mental illness that results in
              unexpected shifts in mood, expanding from extreme limits (manic or
              “mania” episodes) to lows (depressive or “depression” episodes).
              The phrase bipolar consists of two parts:
            </p>
            <li>Bi means 'two'</li>
            <li>Polar means 'opposite'</li>
            <p>
              An individual who has bipolar disorder additionally experiences
              modifications in their energy, behavior, thinking, and sleep. With
              bipolar mood disorder, it is tough to carry out everyday tasks, go
              to the office or school, and continue relationships. The term
              bipolar defines how your mood can modify between two very opposite
              states: mania and depression. Previously, people preferred to
              handle bipolar disorder as a manic-depressive event. You may still
              observe people utilizing this older word today.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet both terms might lead to confusion. People can think it means
              only having mood swings along with severe mania,

              . But bipolar disorder is much more complex than this.

            <h2>What Causes Bipolar Disorder?</h2>
            <p>
              Bipolar disorder impacts millions of individuals in the US. Most
              individuals are identified with bipolar disorder in their twenties
              or teens; however, it might happen at any age, and in cases where
              the symptoms can persist, the majority of individuals find ways to
              treat their symptoms effectively. Individuals are at increased
              risk if they have a family record of bipolar disorder, observe a
              traumatic incidence, and/or misuse alcohol or drugs. Differences
              in brain formation and function may also play a role. If you
              notice that you may have it, consult your healthcare provider.

            </li>
            <li>You observe episodes that prolong months, days, or weeks.</li>
