              Living through a traumatic situation can have severe emotional
              effects. Traumatic experiences can be hard to categorize because a
              single incident may be more painful for one person than for
              another. However, childhood traumas, including abuse, neglect, and
              broken attachments, can be catastrophic. Later life events like an
              unexpected accident, becoming the victim of violence, a natural
              disaster or war, or sudden loss can also be difficult.

            <p>
              Psychological trauma has substantial and long-term effects for

            <h3>Therapy and Treatment Option</h3>
            <p>Here below are some of the options provided by us:</p>
            <h4>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</h4>
            <p>
              Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) treats stress,
              <Link href="/depression-treatment-in-dallas-tx/" rel="preload">
                {" "}

                Our trauma surgeon in Dallas
              </Link>{" "}
              treats anxiousness and depression with cognitive-behavioral
              therapy. Our services promote healthy coping and emotional
              well-being.
            </p>
            <h4>Eye Movement Reprocessing</h4>
            <p>
              EMDR is another popular treatment. It involves a brief reliving of
              traumatic events while the therapist controls eye movements.
              Traumatic memories are processed and integrated using EMDR. It
              helps you reprocess disturbing events to lessen psychological
              effects and improve coping. We offer specific EMDR sessions to
              help you heal.
            </p>
            <h3>Self-care Options</h3>

            <p>
              Self-care helps trauma survivors manage their emotional,
              psychological, and physical effects. The self-care includes:
            </p>
            <h4>Exercise</h4>
            <p>
              Stress triggers fight-or-flight. Exercise may reduce these
              effects. We recommend aerobic exercise which may help PTSD
              patients. You can workout for 30 minutes most days of the week.
            </p>
            <h4>Meditation</h4>
            <p>
              Meditation and yoga are part of our therapy methods to help people
              manage stress, gain self-awareness, and regulate emotions. These
              methods reduce the symptoms and improve well-being.
            </p>
            <h4>A balanced life</h4>
            <p>
              Traumatized people may have trouble relaxing or sleeping. Sleep,
              relaxation, and food affect mental wellness. If feasible, try:
