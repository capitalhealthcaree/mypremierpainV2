            <h3>Medications</h3>
            <p>
              Medical treatments can help ease the signs of both panic attacks
              and depression, if that's a problem for you. Multiple drugs can
              treat panic attack symptoms, including:
            </p>
            <li>
              Serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Panic attack treatment usually
              begins with SSRI antidepressants, which are safe and rarely cause
              major adverse effects. FDA-approved panic disorder SSRIs include
              fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), and sertraline.
            </li>
            <li>
              SNRIs: These are reuptake inhibitors of serotonin and
              norepinephrine. Another class of antidepressants. The FDA-approved
              panic disorder is venlafaxine (Effexor XR).
            </li>
            <p>
              If a medicine doesn't work, your doctor may suggest replacing or
              combining it. After starting a medicine, symptoms may not improve
              for several weeks. All drugs can cause negative effects, and some
              are contraindicated during pregnancy. Discuss the side effects and
              dangers with your doctor.
